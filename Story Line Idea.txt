                    [Your grandmother once spoke of this rare flower that grew in the deep Valley of Seduk.

USER PROMPT:        "Would you like to go home or continue picking flowers?"

SCENE TWO: HOME

SCENE DESCRIPTION:
                    You are in home looking around a small mountain cottage. 
                    It's warm and welcoming, scattered with flowers, 
                    and books, a pot of soup roasts over a fire, and a 
                    single crossbow rest next to the fireplace.

                    There is a small sink, a one room bedroom, 
                    and a living room with a single rocking chair next to the kitchen table. 

USER PROMPT:         

THOUGHTS: 
                    [Their grandmother used to spend a considerable amount of time in the hut out back. 
                    She never knew why an old woman would be so entertained by a secluded shack full of dust, tools, 
                    glass vials.  But she was only a kid, she maybe doesn't remember everything.]

USER PROMPT:        "Would you like to go investigate the hut?"
