    They find a ninroot, a bushelsnap, and a blue mountain flower.

        **Add to inventory**

    They have a thought!
        [Their grandmother once spoke of this rare flower that grew in the deep Valley of Seduk. 
         I actually think she wrote about it in a journal they still have at home.]

Prompt user to go home, or continue picking flowers. This will prompt another thought after a bit, 
to persistently think of that rare flower.  

    SCENE TWO: HOME 

    The character is home looking around a small mountain cottage. It's warm and welcoming, scattered with flowers, 
    and books, a single crossbow rest next to the fireplace. 

Prompt user to look for grandmother's journal. 

The user can't find the journal. 

    They have a thought! 
        [Their grandmother used to spend a considerable amount of time in the hut out back. 
         She never knew why an old woman would be so entertained by a secluded shack full of dust, tools, 
         glass vials.  But she was only a kid, she maybe doesn't remember everything.]

Prompt user to look in shack 

    SCENE THREE: SHACK

    She walks into the shack.  Nobody has been back here since her grandmother passed.
    Dust covers all areas, she can hardly see as the dust particles glittering in the air make her cough. 

The user sees tools, pickaxe, hammer, dagger, shovel. 

    **Can add to inventory, if wanted**

The user still can't find journal, but did find a key

    **Add key to inventory**
