NOTES FOR FIVE DYSFUNCTIONS OF A TEAM
by: Nicole Beck

An overview of the model:
1. Genuine teamwork in most organizations remains as elusive as it has ever been.
2. Organizations fail to achieve teamwork becasue they unknowingly fall prety to five natural but dangerous pitfalls. 

Absence of Trust:
-unwillingness to be vulnerable within the group.

Fear of Conflict:
-lacks trust and are incapable of engaging in unfiltered and passionate debate of ideas. 

Lack of Commitment:
-without having aired their opinions, team members rarely, if ever, buy in and commit to decisions

Avoidance of Accountability:
-without commiting to a clear pan of action, even the most focused and driven people often hesitate to call their peers on actions and behaviros that seem counterproductive to the good of the team.

Inattention to Results:
-occurs when team members put their individual needs(such as ego, recognition, etc) above collective goals of the team. 

**If one is broken, it all becomes dysfuntional.

ABSENCE OF TRUST:
-in the context of building a team, trust is confidence among team members that their peers' intentions are good. 
-requires team members to make themselves vulnerable to one another, and be confident that their respective vulnerablilities will not be used against them. 
-once achieved, they can focus their energy and attention completely on the job at hand, rather than politics.

suggestions: team building skills, self-assessments, etc.

role of the leader: share first, create an environment that allows for vulnerabilities, etc. 

FEAR OF CONFLICT:
-ideological conflict- limited to concepts and ideas and avoids personality-focused, mean-spirited attacks. 
-teams that avoid ideological conflict often do so in order to avoid hurting tem members' feelings. 

suggestions: mining (extract buried conflict), reminding the team that conflict is necessary, assessment tools. 

role of the leader: allow the conflict to build, facilitate productivity through conflict, demonstrate restraint, etc.

LACK OF COMMITMENT:
-two greated causes of lack of commitment are:
    1. Consensus: great teams ensure that everyon's ideas are genuinely considered.
    2. Certainty: great teams pride themselves on the ability to unite behind decisions and commit to clear courses of action. 
-when an executive team fails to achieve buy-in from all team members, employees who report to those executives will inevitably clash when they try to interpret marching orders. 

suggestions: cascading messaging (what should be communicated to employees?), deadlines, worst-case scenario analysis/consensus, low-risk exposure therapy.

role of the leader: must be comfortable with the prospect of making a decision that ultimately turns out to be wrong, cannot place too high a premium on certainty or consensus. 

AVOIDANCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY:
-unwillingness of tem members to tolerate the interpersonal discomfort that accompanies calling a peer on his or her behavior and the more general tendency to avoid difficult conversations. 
-sometimes avoidance of accountability stems from not wanting to jeapardize personal relationships. 
-the most effective and efficient means of maintaining high standards of performance on a team is peer pressure. 

suggestions: publications of goals and standards, simple and regular progress reviews, team rewards.

role of the leader: naturally create an accountability vacuum within the team, must serve as the arbiter of discipline when the team fails. 

INATTENTION TO RESULTS:
-the ultimate dysfunction of a team is the tendency of members to care about something other than the collective goals of the group. 
-team status, individual status.

suggestions: public declaration of results, results-based rewards, etc.

role of the leader: team leaders must be selfless and objective, and reserve rewards and recognition for those who make real contributions to the achievement of group goals. 

**Teamwork comes down to practicing a small set of principles over a long period of time. 
**By acknowledging the imperfections of their humanity, members of functional teams overcome the natural tendencies that make trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, and a focuse on results so elusive.
