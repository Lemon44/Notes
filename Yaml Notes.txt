PyYaml Documentation overview:

install using pip install PyYaml

**By default, PyYaml chooses the style of collection based on if it has nesting collections. 
    If it doesn't have nesting collections, it will be assigned the flow styl eand not the block style. 

If you always want the collections to be serialized in the block style, set the parameter default_flow_style of dump() to False. 

-- print yaml.dump(yaml.load(document), default_flow_style = False)

Importing Yaml:
    -It is not safe to clal yaml.load with any data received from an untrusted source! 

yaml.load() converts a Yaml document to a Python object. 
    -it returns a python object

If a string or a file contains several documents, you may load them all with the yaml.load_all() function. 

You can construct the instance of a python class by using the ! !python/object tag. 

>>>>>> class Hero:
...     def __init__(self, name, hp, sp):
...         self.name = name
...         self.hp = hp
...         self.sp = sp
...     def __repr__(self):
...         return "%s(name=%r, hp=%r, sp=%r)" % (
...             self.__class__.__name__, self.name, self.hp, self.sp)

>>> yaml.load("""
... !!python/object:__main__.Hero
... name: Welthyr Syxgon
... hp: 1200
... sp: 0
... """)

Hero(name='Welthyr Syxgon', hp=1200, sp=0)

You can make a python object safe and thus recognized by yaml.safe_load.
-You first have to derive it from yaml.YAMLObject
