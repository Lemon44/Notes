Luke's Presentation:

from unittest import mock

def say_the_truth():
	answer = input("What is the question?")
	if answer == "":
		return "the truth"
	return "the truth about " + answer

def test_say_the_truth():
	with mock.patch('builtins.input') as mocked_input:
		mocked_input.side_effect == ["", "the streets"]
		assert say_the_truth() == "the truth"
		assert say_the_truth() == "the truth about the streets"
		assert mocked_input.call_count == 2


def runtests():
		test_say_the_truth()

if __name__ == '__main__':
	runtest()

How to do this with pytest... requirements-dev.txt
	pytest - mock
conftest.py
@pytest.fixture
def run(capys, mocker):

database connections, input/output from a user.

I'm going to run my method, can I understand what I expect to come out.
